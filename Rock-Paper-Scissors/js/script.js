//make a value for Rock. Make value greater than Scissors.
//make a value for Scissors. Make value greater than Paper.
//make a value for Paper. Make value greater than Rock.

//create a function for the computer to select a value randomly 

//create a function that takes two parameters and returns a srting that declares a winner or tie

//Make your functionâ€™s playerSelection parameter case-insensitive (so users can input rock, ROCK, RocK or any other variation).

//Write a NEW function called playGame(). Use the previous function inside of this one to play a five round game that keeps score and reports a winner or loser at the end.






//Note from Discord - ur function i.e: (Math.floor(Math.random() * 3))) executes and returns a random value which is stored into the randomChoice variable. So, it always uses that value unless u re-assign it ðŸ¤” 

//for function computerSelect(randomChoice) I think i need to put in the play function after it and tie it to the player choice to get this to work ie: function computerSelect(randomChoice) {if (computerSelect = 0) return Rock}
